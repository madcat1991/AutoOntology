At Google, we are committed to helping the innovators of the future make the most of their gifts. We believe open source development is a useful and accessible way for passionate students to get practical and rewarding experiences in computer science.

With this in mind, Google is excited to announce our first annual Chrome Academy! Chrome Academy will offer thirty rising sophomores and juniors at universities in the U.S. or Canada the chance to participate in a week-long educational summer program at Googleâ€™s headquarters in Mountain View, California.

The Academy will run from June 16 to June 22, 2013 and will include an interactive and collaborative curriculum focused on providing a practical introduction to developing cutting-edge web applications and Chrome Packaged Applications. In addition, students will explore time-saving frameworks and the tools required for developing, testing, and deploying web applications. Students will also get the opportunity to enjoy technical talks by Googlers, network with other talented students and attend social activities around Silicon Valley.

Applications for Chrome Academy are open now and the deadline to apply is March 17th.  For more information and to submit your application, please visit google.com/students/chromeacademy
